## Cryptography
This is a work in progress folder for the Cryptography lesson :)

**Ciphers:**
Ciphers are the simplest form of Cryptography, and are typically easily reversible!
Your best resources for cracking a cipher are [dcode](dcode.fr) and [CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/), but if you'd like to learn more about some basic ciphers, check out this folder on our GitHub: [Ciphers](../z_Additional%20Resources/Ciphers/)

**Python:**
A ton of typical Cryptography challenges will rely on you being able to reverse a Python script to determine how the flag was encrypted and undo it. We don't teach Python, but if you'd like to learn basic Python, the [w3schools tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/python/) on it!

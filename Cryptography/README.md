## Cryptography

***Ciphers:***
Ciphers are the simplest form of Cryptography, and are typically easily reversible!
Your best resources for cracking a cipher are [dcode](dcode.fr) and [CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/), but if you'd like to learn more about some basic ciphers, check out this folder on our GitHub: [Ciphers](../z_Additional%20Resources/Ciphers/)

***Python:***
A ton of typical Cryptography challenges will rely on you being able to reverse a Python script to determine how the flag was encrypted and undo it. We don't teach Python, but if you'd like to learn basic Python, the [w3schools tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/python/) on it!

### Next Steps

Cryptography is hard to explain all at once. This GitHub will be evolving and growing as we learn more and more about it, and this upcoming list of files explaining the most common encryption algorithms will only grow. The best way for you to learn, however, is for you to go out and do some challenges yourself. Here are two really good places for you to get challenge practice:

* [Cryptohack](https://cryptohack.org/): the Introduction to Cryptohack course is really beginner friendly
* [Cryptopals](https://cryptopals.com/): this is a great place to find challenges, but it doesn't have as pretty of a UI and doesn't take the time to explain to you how could go about solving it. I'd recommend coming here incrementally as you go through Cryptohack for some extra challenges

There's all kinds of places that you could find Crypto challenges, but these are beautifully designed to help you learn rather than just test what you already know.

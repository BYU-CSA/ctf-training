# External Resources
Are you so in love with cybersecurity and CTFs that you want to increase your skills outside of class? Here's a list of resources that you can access to learn on your own! If there are others that you're aware of, let us know in the Slack workspace, and we'll add it here! 

## CTF Platforms
* [CTFtime](https://ctftime.org/event/list/upcoming)
    * This resource is first because it's the most important - this webpage has an extensive list of virtual CTFs happening all around the world. This is where we determine which CTF to participate in each month. If you would like to try one on your own or at your own time, you can find one here! Each CTF is different, and some are more difficult than others.

    * This contains a list of a dozen different cyber wargames you can play to learn skills. Bandit is the first and easiest, and is intended for those who are interested in cybersecurity but haven't used a Linux environment before. Natas is web exploitation-focused. They range in difficulty, and you can only move on to the next level after completing the first one.

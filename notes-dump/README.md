# What is this folder?
This is a place for anyone to dump their notes so that everyone can view and use them. This would work best if the notes contain keywords to make things searchable by adding keywords and all the resources are cited. There's no obligation to a style guide, except to create a folder with your first and last name so that people can reach out to you over the CSA slack.

We aim to make the world a safer place by providing free and approachable Cybersecurity and Capture The Flag resources. Even if all you can contribute is a single page of notes on symmetric cryptography, a quick disclaimer about the difference between Java and Javascript, or a link to a useful OSINT resource, put it up! Someone will find it useful.

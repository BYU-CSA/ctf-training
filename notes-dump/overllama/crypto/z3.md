So you'll typically always start with a solver: `solver = Solver()`. This creates the package you can then add rules to and solve under.

When you want to populate a piece of information to later be filled by the solve, you use the `BitVec()` function. This creates a set of bits in memory that are filled by whatever placeholder you give them. So in the MAG solve from DUCTF2024, it used 
```python
key_words = [BitVec(f'k{i}', 32) for i in range(8)]
```
to generate a list of 8 elements that started off the array for generation (or the flag split into 8, 32-bit parts)
`LShR()` is logical shift right

z3 supports a bunch of logical operators, such as `And()`, `Or()`, and `Not()`, which are really useful when there are multiple conditions to a solve
When you've finished populating the solver, use `solver.check()` to verify it's satiability. If it's solvable / solved, it'll `== sat` and otherwise `== unsat`.
Then, you can output the solved model using `solver.model()` and operate on the generated array to get the solutions you needed
One thing with z3 is it won't always work. The complexity of the solve always comes into play when working with solvers like this. Sometimes you'll have to take the solve concept into something like a lattice reduction instead.

#### Example solve script (MAG DUCTF2024)
```python
from z3 import *
import random

"""
The flag is a 32 byte value used as the key for MyArrayGenerator which is an
LFSR-like stream cipher. 1280 bytes of plaintext/ciphertext are given, so we
have access to 1280 bytes of the keystream output. Noting that the registers
are basically only ever XORs of the initial key words, we can reimplement the
generator in Z3. The conditional XOR by 0xFFFFFFFF in the update method can be
dealt with by ignoring it in the generator itself and considering it only later
when trying to solve the system. As its effect is only equivalent to XORing the
output keystream byte by 0xFF, combining this with the fact that the initial
key words are ASCII only is enough to solve.

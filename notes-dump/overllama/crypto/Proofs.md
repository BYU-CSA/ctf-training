Ask what each symbol means! Literally any time that it has math written out, ask them to explain all the symbols and what that means (especially in regards to the negation map)
What does the \[B!] mean on page 2
What does the # mean on page 2
I wanna understand the quadratic twist section on page 4

### Symbols
double-struck Z : the set of all integers (negative, zero, and positive whole numbers)
double-struck F : the set of all integers in a finite field
double-struck P : some set of prime numbers
double-struck N : some set of natural numbers (usually including 0)
squiggly-equals is congruence

### Terms
**Commute**: you can switch the order on the elements of the operation and have the same result
**Negation map**??
**Group law**??
**Morphism**: transforming (mapping) an element into another of the same type within the group in which it is defined (not necessarily inversible)
**Isomorphism**: morphism, but it is inversible
**Endomorphism**: morphism, but you map the element back to itself
**Automorphism**: endomorphism, but it is inversible
**Torsion**:

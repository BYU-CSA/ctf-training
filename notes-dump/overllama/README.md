Hey, guys. I've done a couple CTFs, and I happen to take weirdly detailed notes any time I learn something, so maybe some of this will be useful to you. It's incomplete because my thoughts are all over the place and so are my notes, but I'll update it every once in a while as my understanding changes or becomes more refined. Especially the crypto section. Shoot me a dm if you have any questions. Macen on slack and overllama on discord. glhf

ebfe, or jump minus 2, introduces an infinite loop into the code. Just take a two byte instruction and have it jump to itself (it ends up being an `eb fe` instruction) AND THEN YOU CAN JUST CTRL C IN GDB AND BOOM FLAG
Patching a binary is a really useful thing to do, especially with symmetric encryption. You can also just patch... anywhere. So you can just add assembly to run printf wherever as long as you remember to load the right registers in beforehand. He really added print debugging into a compiled executable. This is a lot harder to do in some situations where you have maybe the wrong number of instructions or a different architecture. It also requires you to know assembly really well.

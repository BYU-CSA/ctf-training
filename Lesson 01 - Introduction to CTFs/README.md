# Lesson 1 - Introduction to CTFs
Welcome to our GitHub repo where we teach lessons about tools and methods used in Capture the Flag competitions! This is an online resource that you can access whenever you'd like. We plan on including scripts, links, tools, code, examples, and others to help you become more successful in CTFs! Our goal is to have multiple teams progress in our monthly CTF competitions that we participate in, and this is how we plan on doing it!

## Beginners Doc
Not sure what a CTF is or how it works? Don't worry, we've written up [a document](https://github.com/JustinApplegate/ctf-training/blob/main/Beginners.md) that can help answer some of the questions you may have about them. In that beginner document is a list of basic skills that we're assuming (I know, so rude of us!) that you already have. If you aren't comfortable with those skills, we have a list of resources to learn them because they will be essential in using the tools and methods we'll teach. 

## Topics?
What do you want to learn? We've already included a list of [future topics](https://github.com/JustinApplegate/ctf-training/blob/main/Future_Topics.md) that we want to cover, but if there's something in particular you've been *dying* to learn, or something we don't have, let us know in Slack!

## Linux
When it comes to cybersecurity and CTF competitions, having access to a Linux environment is at the very least super helpful, if not essential. There are several tools that have not been written for use in a Windows environment. So, what are your options??

* [Installing WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10)
* [Virtual machine](https://itsfoss.com/install-linux-in-virtualbox/)
* [Dual-boot](https://itsfoss.com/install-ubuntu-1404-dual-boot-mode-windows-8-81-uefi/)
* Bare metal (Linux being the only OS)

## Writeups
To really understand how CTF problems are solved and how to approach them, it's best to go over writeups. After many CTFs, participants will make "writeups", where they go through the problem solving process step by step. They'll include screenshots and links to external resources so others who couldn't solve the problem could learn from them. We created a few writeups for challenges that we've solved, and linked them below:

* [baby_python_fixed](https://ctftime.org/writeup/29653) - jail
* [Tablet 2](https://ctftime.org/writeup/29647) - web
* [Tedious](https://ctftime.org/writeup/29621) - reverse engineering
* [Charlie Chaplin 1](https://ctftime.org/writeup/29646) - OSINT

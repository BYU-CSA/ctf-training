# Web Exploitation
Almost everything these days is on a web server, and there are seemingly endless ways to attack web pages. This guide introduces some basic web exploitation techniques. This list is definitely *not* exhaustive, but could be used as a starting point for a web exploitation CTF problem.

### Developer Tools
Often called "the ultimate hacking tool", looking at the source code for a web page is a must! A web page can include just plain HTML, but often it has JavaScript, CSS, external images, a favicon, API calls, etc. This is your best resource for web challenges.

Use CTRL + I to access the developer tools. If a web page blocks CTRL + I, you can still access the developer tools through a certain method in whichever browser you are using (you can Google how to do that). Some of the common tools will be modules of the browser Developer Tools.

### HTTP Requests and Responses

Web pages are delivered to your computer because of the beauty of the HTTP request and HTTP response. The HTTP request is what you send to whichever server hosts the web page. The request tells the server which webpage content you want, and in what format the server needs to return the content. An HTTP request also contains a little about the client that is requesting the content. An HTTP response is the response from the server of the webpage. Usually when we analyze the HTTP requests and responses, we are primarily focusing on the HTTP headers. To view an example of an HTTP request, go to [echo.dicax.org](https://echo.dicax.org). This is a site that is designed to show you the HTTP request that you sent to get it. 

Let's talk about a few key fields of this request:
* The **HTTP method** is the first word in the header, in this case GET. The most common HTTP method is GET. Learn more about HTTP methods in [this article.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods)
* **Host** is the header that contains the address of the responding server. This is who the HTTP requests is going to.
* **User-Agent** specifies which type of browser or software this HTTP request was sent from. This request was sent using Mozilla Firefox, but the User-Agent can be other browsers (Chrome, Tor, etc.) or other software (Nmap has it's own User-Agent value)

## Common Tools and Strategies

* [Browser Network Tab](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/network/)
    * Make sure you look at the network tab! The network tab tells you how data from the website is transferred across the internet. This can be in the form of APIs, POST requests, submitted forms, external data displayed in the page, etc. Check here to see if anything specific happens while you interact with the site.
* [Browser Application Tab](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/#application)
    * Cookies are located in the Application tab. Cookies are used by the browser to send certain user data to the server whenever a request is made for a webpage. Cookies are viewable *and editable* on the client side (your computer) in developer tools. Use these to see how certain cookie values change the site. Cookies are often used for authentication or to display a certain part of the webpage. Also check the local storage section of the Application tab, this is where information is added for the browser to keep, and not the server.
* [Path Traversal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directory_traversal_attack)
    * Every single website is made of up a folder of files on a server somewhere. If the system isn't set up properly, someone could gain access to more files on a server than the owner intended. If a user has open access to see all the files on a server, that is called an *open directory*. If a user navigates within those exposed files, then the user is performing *path traversal*. To navigate around a vulnerable website, try using `..` or `.` or `/../` as the file path.
* [Burp Suite]()
    * Burpsuite is a software application that is used to test the security of websites. The software is developed by PortSwigger, the leader in application security, and the professional license is very good and a little expensive. However, the community version of Burpsuite is sufficient for any CTF. It essentially allows us to quickly and easily send and modify HTTP requests. To download the latest version, go [here](https://portswigger.net/burp/releases/professional-community-2023-10-2-4?requestededition=community&requestedplatform=). Running through steps 1 - 6 of [Burp Suite's Getting Started documentation](https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/desktop/getting-started) will teach you everything you need to know for most CTFs.

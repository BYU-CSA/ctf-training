# CSA Weekly CTF Training
This GitHub repository is used to store lessons for CTF training group meetings held regularly at Brigham Young University-Provo. Each folder contains files, scripts, links, and more for a lesson. We've provided this resource so that new members can see old lessons, follow along with current lessons, and review lessons after the actual training hour. 

Meetings are held each Wednesday from 7:00 PM - 8:00 PM MST, in room 385 in the Crabtree. If you're a student here, we'd love to have you join us!

If there are skills you'd like to learn or resources you want to share, let us know in the Slack workspace, and we'll add it on!

## Beginners
New to CTFs? Not sure how to start? We've provided a document for beginners that details how to get started, then you can go through each week's lessons! Just go to [the Beginners.md page](https://github.com/JustinApplegate/ctf-training/blob/main/Beginners.md) to get started!

## Monthly CTF Competitions
The purpose for these weekly training meetings is to prepare for monthly CTF (Capture the Flag) competitions that we will be participating in. A link to a Google Sheet to sign up for these monthly competitions is found below. Teams can normally have up to 4 people, so in the sign up sheet, you can join a team with less than 4 people, or start your own team. You can even do it solo, but it's much more difficult and stressful. 

## CTFTime
CTFTime is a online platform that tracks results across many CTF's. Think of it as an ESPN for CTFs. We have our own team listed on CTFTime that you can join. Click here for the [link](https://ctftime.org/team/155711) to sign up. It also has a calender of various future CTFs if you want to participate in one outside of the club. If you do want to join one, reach out to Justin or Ian so that we can get the result linked to our team. 

## Future Topics
There are so many things we want to cover, we just don't have enough time. We've created [a Future Topics page](https://github.com/JustinApplegate/ctf-training/blob/main/Future_Topics.md) that lists some of the tools and resources we want to teach in the future. If you want to get ahead or have suggestions that aren't on there, let us know in the Slack workspace!

## Other Resources
If you're interested in using other resources outside of the ones we go through, we've provided a list in [Resource Dump page](https://github.com/JustinApplegate/ctf-training/blob/main/Resource%20Dump.md), so go and take a look!

# BYU Weekly CTF Training
This GitHub repository is used to store lessons for CTF training group meetings held regularly at BYU.

Make this repository better by following the instructions [here](./How-to-add-to-this-repository.md).

## Structure
[`friday-lessons`](./friday-lessons/): Collection of scripts, challenges, and guides used in the weekly Kickstart meetings 

[`notes-dump`](./notes-dump/): A space for people to drop their unstructured notes. This is full of tips, tricks, helpful scripts, and writeups that might help with whatever challenge you're solving! Put any notes that are unpolished here.

[`resources`](./resources/): Various resources that might be too advanced for a single hour-long lesson. Put higher quality writeups, step-by-step guides, links to external resources, and other useful resources here.

## Meetings
Meetings are held each Friday from 5:00 PM - 6:00 PM MST, in room 365 in the Crabtree using the resources in [friday-lessons](./friday-lessons/). If you're a student with an interest in breaking into things, we'd love to have you join us!

## Beginners
New to CTFs? Not sure how to start? We've provided a document for beginners that details how to get started, then you can go through each week's lessons! Just go to [the Beginners.md page](friday-lessons/Beginners.md) to get started!

## Monthly CTF Competitions
We hold weekly meetings to prepare for CTF (Capture the Flag) competitions that we will be participating in. Check out the `cyberkickstart` and `weekly-ctfs` channels in the [slack](byuitc.slack.com) for updates.

## CTFTime
CTFTime is the ESPN for CTFs. We have our own team called BYU Cyberia listed on CTFTime that you should join [here](https://ctftime.org/team/155711). It also has a calender of various future CTFs.

## Future Topics
We've created [a Future Topics page](friday-lessons/Future_Topics.md) that lists some of the tools and resources we want to teach in the future. Feel free to suggest topics in the slack!

## Other Resources
If you're interested in using other resources outside of the ones we go through, we've provided a list in [Resource Dump page](friday-lessons/Resource%20Dump.md), so go and take a look!

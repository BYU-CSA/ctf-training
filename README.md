# BYU Weekly CTF Training
This GitHub repository is used to store lessons for CTF training group meetings held regularly at BYU in Provo.

## Structure
[`friday-lessons`](./friday-lessons/): Collection of scripts, challenges, and guides used in the weekly Kickstart meetings 

[`notes-dump`](./notes-dump/): A space for people to drop their unstructured notes. This is full of tips, tricks, helpful scripts, and writeups that might help with whatever challenge you're solving!

[`resources`](./resources/): Various resources that might be too advanced for a single hour-long lesson. Put higher-quality writeups, step-by-step guides, links to resources, and other useful resources here.

## Meetings
Meetings are held each Friday from 5:00 PM - 6:00 PM MST, in room 365 in the Crabtree using the resources in [friday-lessons](./friday-lessons/). If you're a student with an interest in breaking into things, we'd love to have you join us!

## Beginners
New to CTFs? Not sure how to start? We've provided a document for beginners that details how to get started, then you can go through each week's lessons! Just go to [the Beginners.md page](https://github.com/JustinApplegate/ctf-training/blob/main/Beginners.md) to get started!

## Monthly CTF Competitions
We hold weekly meetings to prepare for frequent CTF (Capture the Flag) competitions that we will be participating in.

## CTFTime
CTFTime is the ESPN for CTFs. We have our own team called BYU Cyberia listed on CTFTime that you should join [here](https://ctftime.org/team/155711bb). It also has a calender of various future CTFs.

## Future Topics
We've created [a Future Topics page](https://github.com/JustinApplegate/ctf-training/blob/main/Future_Topics.md) that lists some of the tools and resources we want to teach in the future. Feel free to suggest topics in the slack!

## Other Resources
If you're interested in using other resources outside of the ones we go through, we've provided a list in [Resource Dump page](https://github.com/JustinApplegate/ctf-training/blob/main/Resource%20Dump.md), so go and take a look!

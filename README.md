# CSA Weekly CTF Training
This GitHub repository is used to store previous and current lessons from our weekly CTF training meetings. Each folder contains files, scripts, links, and more for that week's lesson. We've provided this resource so that new members can see old lessons, and lessons can be reviewed after the actual training hour. 

Meetings are held each Wednesday from 7:00 PM - 8:00 PM MST, currently through Zoom. Once Fall 2021 starts, we will try to hold it in-person. The link for the Zoom call is found below.

If there are skills you'd like to learn or resources you want to share, let us know in the Slack workspace, and we'll add it on!

## Monthly CTF Competitions
The purpose for these weekly training meetings is to prepare for monthly CTF (Capture the Flag) competitions that we will be participating in. A link to a Google Sheet to sign up for these monthly competitions is found below. Teams can normally have up to 4 people, so in the sign up sheet, you can join a team with less than 4 people, or start your own team. You can even do it solo, but it's much more difficult and stressful. 

## Beginners
New to CTFs? Not sure how to start? We've provided a document for beginners that details how to get started, then you can go through each week's lessons! Just go to [the Beginners.md page](https://github.com/JustinApplegate/ctf-training/blob/main/Beginners.md) to get started!

## Future Topics
There are so many things we want to cover, we just don't have enough time. We've created [a Future Topics page](https://github.com/JustinApplegate/ctf-training/blob/main/Future_Topics.md) that lists some of the tools and resources we want to teach in the future. If you want to get ahead or have suggestions that aren't on there, let us know in the Slack workspace!

## Other Resources
If you're interested in using other resources outside of the ones we go through, we've provided a list in [Lesson 1's README page](https://github.com/JustinApplegate/ctf-training/blob/main/Lesson%201%20-%20Introduction%20to%20CTFs/README.md), so go and take a look!

# CSA Weekly CTF Training
This GitHub repository is used to store previous and current lessons from our weekly CTF training meetings. Each folder contains files, scripts, links, and more for that week's lesson. We've provided this resource so that new members can see old lessons, and lessons can be reviewed after the actual training hour. 

Meetings are held each Wednesday from 7:00 PM - 8:00 PM MST, currently through Zoom. Once Fall 2021 starts, we will try to hold it in-person. The link for the Zoom call is found below.

## Monthly CTF Competitions
The purpose for these weekly training meetings is to prepare for monthly CTF (Capture the Flag) competitions that we will be participating in. A link to a Google Sheet to sign up for these monthly competitions is found below. Teams can normally have up to 4 people, so in the sign up sheet, you can join a team with less than 4 people, or start your own team. You can even do it solo, but it's much more difficult and stressful. 

## Beginners
New to CTFs? Not sure how to start? Our first lesson focuses on how CTFs work, some basic skills, and how to get access to a Linux environment. As the weeks progress, we will focus on more specific skills or reviewing past CTF challenges. Look at [Week 1 - Introduction to CTFs](tree/main/Lesson%201%20-%20Introduction%20to%20CTFs) to get started!

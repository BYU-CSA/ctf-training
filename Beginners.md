# Beginners
Capture the Flag competitions challenge you to complete problems by learning and applying skills that are useful in real-life cybersecurity careers. They can be done alone, but many allow you to have teams of participants, usually up to 4 people. 

The most common style is jeopardy, where there is a range of topics covered and each topic has some problems worth points. Some common categories include web exploitation, binary exploitation, reverse engineering, cryptography, and forensics. Each competition is run a little differently, and they range in difficulty. Some are held annually, some semi-anually, and others only once. 

Sometimes, the amount of points you get from each completed challenge decreases as more people complete them (ie, the easier challenges are worth less points). 

[Here](https://ctf101.org/) is a great resource that goes over some of the topics covered in CTFs. 
Another good introduction or explanation to CTFs is [here](https://securityintelligence.com/behind-the-scenes-at-a-capture-the-flag-ctf-competition/), an article by SecurityIntelligence. 
## Skills We Won't Cover
* Programming
    * Knowing programming languages isn't the focus of cybersecurity or CTFs, but they are essential in completing some challenges. The most important ones to know are Python, HTML/CSS/JavaScript, SQL, PHP, and Assembly, in that order.

    * [HTML tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp)
    * [CSS tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp)
    * [JavaScript tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp)
    * [SQL tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/default.asp)
    * [PHP tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/php/default.asp)
    * [Assembly tutorial](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/assembly_programming/index.htm)
* Linux
    * Having access a Linux environment is *SO* important, but we won't be covering Linux basics such as moving directories or creating files, etc.

    * [Linux cheatsheet](https://linoxide.com/linux-commands-cheat-sheet/)
    * [Linux CLI tutorial](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/command-line-for-beginners#1-overview)
* JavaScript Console
    * Exploiting, debugging, and understanding webpages is often made worlds easier by using your browser's console.

* Hashing
    * While we *will* be covering some about tips and tricks to crack password hashes, we won't cover what hashes are or how they are made. 
    * [Intro to Hashing](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/dec/15/passwords-hacking-hashing-salting-sha-2)
    * [Why you can't unhash a hash](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6603849/why-is-it-not-possible-to-reverse-a-cryptographic-hash)
* Git
    * Git is used in almost every software development project, and it keeps track of previous changes. We will cover some interesting aspects of Git in the future, but understand what Git is and how it works is really important
    * [Version control tutorial](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/what-is-version-control)

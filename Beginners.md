# Beginners
Capture the Flag competitions challenge you to complete problems by learning and applying skills that are useful in real-life cybersecurity careers. They can be done alone, but many allow you to have teams of participants, usually up to 4 people. 

The most common style is jeopardy, where there is a range of topics covered and each topic has some problems worth points. Some common categories include web exploitation, binary exploitation, reverse engineering, cryptography, and forensics. Each competition is run a little differently, and they range in difficulty. Some are held annually, some semi-anually, and others only once. 

[Here](https://ctf101.org/) is a great resource that goes over some of the topics covered in CTFs. 

## Feeling Intimidated?
Thinking of participating in a Capture the Flag competition but feeling intimidated because it's very unfamiliar? This is what a CTF environment is like here at BYU. 

Jeopardy-style CTFs run like this - BYU forms at least one team (or multiple if there is a team size limit) when we compete in CTFs. Our default team is BYU Cyberia, [which you can find on CTFTime.org](https://ctftime.org/team/155711). Most competitions are 1-3 days taking place during a weekend. We all gather on the 3rd floor of the CTB with our laptops and sit in a room working on challenges. Depending on the challenge times and motivation levels, we may stay up late or get up very early to spend more time on challenges. Simple challenges can take between 5 to 30 minutes, while the more difficult ones can take from 1 to 4 hours. There are some challenges that have taken us upwards of 10 hours to complete, but they are worth lots of points. 

Each competition is run just a little bit differently. Most will give you dozens of challenges that require you to use or learn skills related to a specific expertise in cybersecurity. For example, web challenges may require you to find ways to do XSS or SQL injection. Reverse engineering challenges will give you a binary file, which you must reverse engineer to figure out what it's doing and how it validates any inputs. Each time you complete a challenge, you'll end up with a long string of unique text known as a "flag". You submit these flags for points. 

While some of us here at BYU are die-hard CTF fans and will clear entire weekends to work on problems, we don't expect that level of commitment from everyone. If you only have a few hours, we'll take it! If you feel like you don't know enough, the truth is **everyone does**. The whole point of CTFs is to become an expert in something that you've only learned existed minutes before. So let me repeat this - **no one knows what they're doing, even after months or years of competing**. We might have more experience or seem like we always know what we're doing, but we all get challenges that it seems like so many other teams or teammates can complete. This is called "imposter syndrome". It's huge in our career field, I promise. Look it up.

So if you don't have a lot of time or experience, **we don't care**. It benefits both you and us to compete. You'll learn new skills and meet more like-minded people, and we get more challenges completed and points earned. How well we do on competitions is heavily based on time spent on challenges, so we'll take any extra time you can offer.

## Skills We Won't Cover
* Programming
    * Knowing programming languages isn't the focus of cybersecurity or CTFs, but they are essential in completing some challenges. The most important ones to know are Python, HTML/CSS/JavaScript, SQL, PHP, and Assembly, in that order.

* Hashing
    * While we *will* be covering some about tips and tricks to crack password hashes, we won't cover what hashes are or how they are made.

* Git
    * Git is used in almost every software development project, and it keeps track of previous changes. We will cover some interesting aspects of Git in the future, but understand what Git is and how it works is really important
